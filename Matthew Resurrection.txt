028:001 Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.
028:002 Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky, and came and rolled away the stone from the door, and sat on it.
028:003 His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.
028:004 For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men.
028:005 The angel answered the women, "Don't be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified.
028:006 He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying.
028:007 Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.' Behold, I have told you."
028:008 They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.
028:009 As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, "Rejoice!" They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
028:010 Then Jesus said to them, "Don't be afraid. Go tell my brothers that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see me."
