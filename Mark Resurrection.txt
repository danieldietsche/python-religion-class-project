016:001 When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint him.
016:002 Very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen.
016:003 They were saying among themselves, "Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?"
016:004 for it was very big. Looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back.
016:005 Entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were amazed.
016:006 He said to them, "Don't be amazed. You seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen. He is not here. Behold, the place where they laid him!
016:007 But go, tell his disciples and Peter, 'He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see him, as he said to you.'"
016:008 They went out, and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come on them. They said nothing to anyone; for they were afraid.
016:009 Now when he had risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.
016:010 She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept.
016:011 When they heard that he was alive, and had been seen by her, they disbelieved.
