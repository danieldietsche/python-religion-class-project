020:001 Now on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene went early, while it was still dark, to the tomb, and saw the stone taken away from the tomb.
020:002 Therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, "They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have laid him!"
020:003 Therefore Peter and the other disciple went out, and they went toward the tomb.
020:004 They both ran together. The other disciple outran Peter, and came to the tomb first.
020:005 Stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths lying, yet he didn't enter in.
020:006 Then Simon Peter came, following him, and entered into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying,
020:007 and the cloth that had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself.
020:008 So then the other disciple who came first to the tomb also entered in, and he saw and believed.
020:009 For as yet they didn't know the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead.
020:010 So the disciples went away again to their own homes.
020:011 But Mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping. So, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb,
020:012 and she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
020:013 They told her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She said to them, "Because they have taken away my Lord, and I don't know where they have laid him."
020:014 When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, and didn't know that it was Jesus.
020:015 Jesus said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?" She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away."
020:016 Jesus said to her, "Mary." She turned and said to him, "Rhabbouni!" which is to say, "Teacher!"
020:017 Jesus said to her, "Don't touch me, for I haven't yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brothers, and tell them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'"
020:018 Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things to her.
