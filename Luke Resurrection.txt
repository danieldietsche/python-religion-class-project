024:001 But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they and some others came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.
024:002 They found the stone rolled away from the tomb.
024:003 They entered in, and didn't find the Lord Jesus' body.
024:004 It happened, while they were greatly perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling clothing.
024:005 Becoming terrified, they bowed their faces down to the earth. They said to them, "Why do you seek the living among the dead?
024:006 He isn't here, but is risen. Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee,
024:007 saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again?"
024:008 They remembered his words,
024:009 returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.
024:010 Now they were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James. The other women with them told these things to the apostles.
024:011 These words seemed to them to be nonsense, and they didn't believe them.
024:012 But Peter got up and ran to the tomb. Stooping and looking in, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he departed to his home, wondering what had happened.
